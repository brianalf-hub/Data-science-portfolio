# Data-science-portfolio

Welcome to my professional data science portfolio. My name is Brian Alfaro. As I am typing this text, I am still a PhD candidate at the University if New Mexico (UNM, Albuquerque), but if you are reading this a couple of months from my first addition, then I may already be holding my doctorate in plant ecological genetics. While my expertise is in experimental plant biology, throughout my career in graduate school I was/am involved in three academic big data projects in our department. <br />

### The first project examined how the association of oceanic environments and animal physiology interact to shape global patterns of biodiversity in our oceans. For this project, I mined and cleaned the data and was in charge of geographic information system (GIS) analysis that used more than 1 million data points.

### Second to anthropogenic habitat degradation, invasive plants are a major factor for loss of global biodiversity. We used vegetation survey data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey from 1997 to 2007, and climate data from WorldClim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) to identify and predict climatic factors that affect the diversity of invasive plants in the southwestern United States.

### Agricultural crop yields are projected to become insufficient in the face of increasing world population and rapid global changes that include environmental and climatic factors. To determine how rapidly changing climate variation will affect canola oil yields, I used georeferenced USDA seed accession data to calculate regional averages of oil yields, and climate data from WorldClim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html). I then used the GIS capabilities of R to 1) perform a spatially-filtered model selection of climatic variables via a maximum likelihood ratio approach, and to 2) perform Bayesian spatial modeling to create a GIS map prediction of global oil yields. I will use the predicted database from this GIS model to train a regression model and use machine learning to predict how canola oil yield will respond to different future climate change scenarios.
