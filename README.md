# Data-science-portfolio

Welcome to my professional data science portfolio. My name is Brian Alfaro. As I am typing this text, I am still a PhD candidate at the University if New Mexico (UNM, Albuquerque), but if you are reading this a couple of months from my first addition, then I may already be holding my doctorate in plant ecological genetics. While my expertise is in experimental plant biology, throughout my career in graduate school I was involved in three academic big data projects in our department.

### For this project, I cleaned the data and was in charge of geographic information system (GIS) analysis of oceanic apex predators that contained more than 1 million data points [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/eaat4220](url)
