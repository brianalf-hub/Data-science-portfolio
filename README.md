# Data-science-portfolio

Welcome to my professional data science portfolio. My name is Brian Alfaro. As I am typing this text, I am still a PhD candidate at the University if New Mexico (UNM, Albuquerque), but if you are reading this a couple of months from my first addition, then I may already be holding my doctorate in plant ecological genetics. While my expertise is in experimental plant biology, throughout my career in graduate school I was/am involved in three academic big data projects in our department. 

The first project examined how the association of oceanic environments and animal physiology interact to shape global patterns of biodiversity in our oceans.

### For this project, I mined and cleaned the data and was in charge of geographic information system (GIS) analysis that used more than 1 million data points [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/eaat4220](url)
