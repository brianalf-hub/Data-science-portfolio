# Academic and Professional Projects

### Welcome to my projects README. My name is Brian Alfaro. As I am typing this text, I am still a PhD candidate at the University of New Mexico (UNM, Albuquerque) in Prof. Diane L. Marshall's lab, but if you are reading this a couple of months from my first addition, then I may already be holding my doctorate in plant ecological genetics. While my expertise is in experimental plant biology, throughout my career in graduate school I was/am involved in three academic big data projects in our department. <br />

## The effect of bio-climatic factors on global yield of canola oil

### Importance of study. Canola oil is an important food ingredient, and can also be used as a biofuel. By expanding this model, I can determine which climatic factors affect yield for each *Brassica* oil crop. The resulting predictive model can provide a guide that shows which regions in the world these canola species can grow and produce oil abundantly, so growers both small- and industrial-scale can plan their crops accordingly.

### Background. We examined how the association of oceanic environments and animal physiology interact to shape global patterns of biodiversity in our oceans. For this project, I mined and cleaned the data and was in charge of geographic information system (GIS) analysis that used more than 1 million data points (Grady et al. 2019, Science). 

### Results. The pattern of marine predator diversity is opposite the pattern of animals in land. In terrestrial environments, the highest diversity is in the tropics, while for marine predators the highest amount of species richness is in the polar regions. This pattern, while driven by environmental factors, is largely due to the physiology of marine predators and prey. In cold waters the capture of cold-blooded prey is easier, so warm-blooded predators tend to swarm polar regions.
